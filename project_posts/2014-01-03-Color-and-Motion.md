This morning I spent some time playing with the D3 force physics engine and the types of imagery I could create by randomizing force properties and manipulating node and link strengths.  First that required data so I tossed off a quick script in python to generate json data to populate the physics engine.  Below is a video of the initial project load and then a few cycles of random physics properties applied.  

I am fading in random colors and debating whether I should constrain each color cycle to single palette or let colors continuously vary along the full spectrum.

The final project will be projected on a large wall and while I want the effect to at times chaotic, I more like the flowing, jellyfish like feel.  Still playing.
