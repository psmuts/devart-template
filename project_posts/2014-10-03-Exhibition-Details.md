The exhibition display will be a projection of the project running in a Google Chrome browser window in presentation mode.  Because the project is changing constantly and unpredictably there should be seating of some kind, preferably bean bags or lounging chairs that allow visitors to live with and become absorbed in the work.  Such a space will also encourage visitors to add their own words to the word cloud via their smartphones and web interface to the project.

On the implementation side, the installation only requires an Internet connected computer and a projector.  The browser will connect to the project backend via http and a REST API implemented using Bottle and running on Google App Engine.
