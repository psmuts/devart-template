Color in the project will vary from monochromatic grays and whites to a variety of randomly selected, but harmoniously chosen, palettes.  Palettes will transition node by node, incrementally over some period, stabilize into a new scheme, then begin to transition again.  I am playing with the idea of different tones for different times of day but haven't implemented that yet.  

While the colors themselves hold no particular significance, the device of slowly transitioning the changing schemes I think draws viewers in, allowing them to be patient and curious while the various sentences are coming and going.  I think here of Nassim Taleb's ideas concerning randomness, namely that in order to encounter the beautiful we must expose ourselves to as many chances of it as possible.  Seduction is key.
